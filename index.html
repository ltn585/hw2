    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      Link is from Sacaramento, California. He just turned 2 years old in November.
      He spent the first year of his life in San Francisco. He moved to Chicago
      with his parents in October 2014. He enjoys the snow but he misses the hiking
      trails and beaches in the Bay area. Even though he likes almost all kinds of
      food, his favorites are tomatos and cucumbers. His parents think they are
      healthy for him.
