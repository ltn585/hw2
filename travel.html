    <h3>March 2012</h3>
    <p>
      In March 2012, I was fortunate to be sent to Singapore for a work trip. This
      was not my first time there but I was still very excited because
      I was only 6 years old the last time I was there. My husband and I stayed at the Fullerton hotel,
      which is also a General Post Office (how interesting!). The weather was hot and humid
      but it's only March so it can be worse in the summer. We vistied the Sand hotel, Chinatown
      and a few hindu temples. My most favorite place was the Sri Mariamman temple in the Chinatown
      district. It's so interesting to see the vibrant culture in this city. Now, get to the
      good and delicious part, Food! As a reflection of its diversity, the food here is
      also very diverse and tasty. I loved the chilli crab which is a whole crab roasted in a
      special red sauce, served with soft baked buns. I had the same dish at least twice
      when I was there. I hope to have a chance to go back soon!
